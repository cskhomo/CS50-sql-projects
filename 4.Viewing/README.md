# Week 4: Viewing

This folder contains my SQL solutions for Week 4 of **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL**, focusing on creating **views** to simplify, aggregate, partition, and secure data in relational databases.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Creating **views** with `CREATE VIEW` to simplify and structure queries
- Implementing **temporary views** using `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW`
- Using **common table expressions (CTEs)** for partitioning and aggregations
- Designing views for **data aggregation** across multiple records
- Implementing views for **data security** and soft deletions
- Handling real-world datasets to create reusable, query-ready structures

## Problem Sets

- **Nepal Census** – Created views to extract rural municipalities, aggregate totals, sum data by district, and identify the most populated districts in Nepal from census data  
- **Private Cipher** – Built a view to decode a book cipher from *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, using substrings to reconstruct a message from sentence triplets  
- **Boston BnB Analysis** – Generated views to analyze AirBnB listings: removing descriptions, filtering one-bedroom units, identifying available dates, frequently reviewed properties, and June 2023 vacancies

> [!NOTE]  
> Each `.sql` file contains the statements needed to create a specific view, independent of other views.
