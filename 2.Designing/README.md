# Week 2: Designing

This folder contains my SQL solutions for Week 2 of **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL**, focusing on **designing normalized relational databases**, implementing **constraints**, and modeling **real-world entities**.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Designing **normalized database schemas** for real-world scenarios
- Applying `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` **constraints**
- Enforcing column rules using `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, `NOT NULL`, and `UNIQUE`
- Managing table structure with `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`
- Ensuring **data integrity** and efficient storage with **type affinities** and **constraints**

## Problem Sets

- **Airport Travel** – Designed a database for Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, modeling **passengers**, **flights**, **airlines**, and **check-ins**
- **Donut Shop** – Created a schema for Union Square Donuts, tracking **donuts**, **ingredients**, **orders**, and **customers**
- **LinkedIn Users** – Built a database representing **LinkedIn users**, **schools**, **companies**, and **professional connections**

> [!NOTE]  
> The `.sql` files each contain a **schema** that solves a specific problem.
