# Week 1: Relating

This folder contains my SQL solutions for Week 1 of **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL**, focusing on querying relationships between tables in relational databases.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Understanding and implementing `one-to-one`, `one-to-many`, and `many-to-many` relationships
- Writing `subqueries` and filtering with `IN` and `WHERE`
- Applying `JOIN`s: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `NATURAL JOIN`
- Performing set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- Grouping and summarizing data with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`

## Problem Sets

- **Moneyball** – Analyzed historical baseball data, extracting player statistics, salary trends, and team performance across multiple tables
- **Packages** – Traced package delivery information across related tables, identifying locations, recipients, and contents
- **DESE** – Examined Massachusetts school district data, connecting schools, staff evaluations, expenditures, and graduation rates to extract actionable insights

> [!NOTE]  
> The `.sql` files each contain a single query that solves a specific problem.
