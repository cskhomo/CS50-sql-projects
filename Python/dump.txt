 implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

from emoji import emojize

def main():

    message = input('Input: ')
    print(f"Output: {text_to_emoji(message)}")

def text_to_emoji(text):
    return  emojize(text, language='alias')

main()



implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

from pyfiglet import Figlet
from random import choice
from sys import argv
from sys import exit


def main():

    figlet = Figlet()
    figFonts = figlet.getFonts()

    if len(argv) == 1:

        figlet.setFont(font=choice(figFonts))
        print(f"Output: \n{figlet.renderText(input('Input: '))}")
        exit()

    if len(argv) == 3:
        if argv[1] == '-f' or argv[1] == '--font':
            if argv[2] in figFonts:

                figlet.setFont(font=argv[2])
                print(f"Output: \n{figlet.renderText(input('Input: '))}")
                exit()

    exit("Invalid Argument(s)!!")

main()



implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names with one and, three names with two commas and one and, and
 names with
 commas and one and, as in the below:

Adieu, adieu, to Liesl
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl

import inflect

def main():

    engine = inflect.engine()

    names = lst()

    while True:

        try: name = input("Name: ")

        except (EOFError):
            print()
            break

        else:
            names.append(name)
            continue

    print(f"Adieu, adieu, to {engine.join(names)}")

main()



implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level,
. If the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates an integer between 1 and
, inclusive, using the random module.
Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.
If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.

from random import randint

def main():

    while True:

        try: target = randint(1, int(input("Level: ")))

        except (ValueError): continue

        else: break

    while True:

        try: guess = int(input("Guess: "))

        except (ValueError): continue

        else:

            if guess > target:
                print("Too large!")

            elif guess < target:
                print("Too small!")

            else: break

            continue

    print("Just right!")

    exit()

main()
