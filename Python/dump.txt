implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level,
. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with
 digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
The program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:

import random


def main():
    ...


def get_level():
    ...


def generate_integer(level):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

import random

def main():

    level = get_level()
    score = generate_integer(level)

    print(f"Score: {score}")

def get_level():

    while True:

        try: level = int(input("Level: "))

        except: continue

        else:
            if 1 <= level <= 3:
                return level

def generate_integer(level):

    start = [0, 10, 100][level-1]
    stop = 10**level - 1
    score = 10

    for i in range(10):

        x = random.randint(start,stop)
        y = random.randint(start,stop)
        trials = 3
        z = x + y

        while trials != 0:

            if str(z) == input(f"{x} + {y} = "): break

            else: print("EEE")

            trials -= 1

            if trials == 0:
                print(f"{x} + {y} = {z}")
                score -= 1

    return score

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins,
, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of
 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import requests
import sys

def main():

    try: coins = float(sys.argv[1])

    except(IndexError): sys.exit("Missing command-line argument")

    except(ValueError): sys.exit("Command-line argument is not a number")

    else:
        rate = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json").json()["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"]
        price = coins * rate
        print(f"${str(price)[:2]},{str(price)[2:]}")

main()
