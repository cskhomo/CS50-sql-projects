implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names with one and, three names with two commas and one and, and
 names with
 commas and one and, as in the below:

Adieu, adieu, to Liesl
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl and Friedrich
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, and Louisa
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, and Kurt
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, and Brigitta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, and Marta
Adieu, adieu, to Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl

implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level,
. If the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates an integer between 1 and
, inclusive, using the random module.
Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.
If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.

from random import randint

def main():

    while True:

        try: target = randint(1, int(input("Level: ")))

        except (ValueError): continue

        else: break

    while True:

        try: guess = int(input("Guess: "))

        except (ValueError): continue

        else:

            if guess > target:
                print("Too large!")

            elif guess < target:
                print("Too small!")

            else: break

            continue

    print("Just right!")

    exit()

implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level,
. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with
 digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
The program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:

def generate_integer(level):

    start = [0, 10, 100][level-1]
    stop = 10**level - 1
    score = 10

    for i in range(10):

        x = random.randint(start,stop)
        y = random.randint(start,stop)
        trials = 3
        z = x + y

        while trials != 0:

            if str(z) == input(f"{x} + {y} = "): break

            else: print("EEE")

            trials -= 1

implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins,
, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of
 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import requests
import sys

def main():

    try: coins = float(sys.argv[1])

    except(IndexError): sys.exit("Missing command-line argument")

    except(ValueError): sys.exit("Command-line argument is not a number")

    else:
        rate = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json").json()["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"]
        price = coins * rate
        print(f"${str(price)[:2]},{str(price)[2:]}")

main()
