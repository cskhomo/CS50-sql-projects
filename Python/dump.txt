implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins,
, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of
 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import requests
import sys

def main():

    try: coins = float(sys.argv[1])

    except(IndexError): sys.exit("Missing command-line argument")

    except(ValueError): sys.exit("Command-line argument is not a number")

    else:
        rate = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json").json()["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"]
        price = coins * rate
        print(f"${str(price)[:2]},{str(price)[2:]}")

main()
