# Week 1: Relating

These exercises focus on **understanding and querying relationships between tables** in relational databases.

## Key Topics

- One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- Subqueries and filtering with `IN` and `WHERE`
- Joins:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`
  - `NATURAL JOIN`
- Set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- Grouping and aggregation: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`

## Purpose of the Exercises

- **Moneyball**: Analyze historical baseball data to uncover player value, salary trends, and team performance. Queries explore player salaries, performances, and team statistics across multiple related tables.
- **Packages**: Trace missing packages through related tables (addresses, packages, scans, drivers) to identify locations, recipients, and contents of deliveries.
- **DESE**: Examine relationships between school districts, individual schools, staff evaluations, expenditures, and graduation rates to extract insights about Massachusetts public education.

> [!NOTE]
> The `.sql` files each contain a single query that solves a specific problem.
