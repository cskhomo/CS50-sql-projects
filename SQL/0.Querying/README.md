# Week 0: Querying

This week introduces the foundations of working with relational databases using SQL. The exercises focus on **retrieving, filtering, and summarizing data** from various databases.

## Key Topics

- Understanding tables, databases, and how a Database Management System (DBMS) organizes data
- Writing basic `SELECT` queries to retrieve specific columns
- Filtering data with `WHERE` conditions, including `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `NULL`
- Pattern matching with `LIKE`
- Sorting results using `ORDER BY` and limiting output with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- Using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `ROUND`, `DISTINCT`, etc.) to summarize data

## Purpose of the Exercises

- **Cyberchase**: Learn to query a real-world dataset of TV episodes, practicing filtering, ordering, and aggregation
- **Normals**: Explore scientific datasets, working with numeric data, ranges, and averages
- **Players**: Apply querying skills to a historical sports dataset, extracting insights about players’ statistics and attributes

> [!NOTE]
> The `.sql` files each contain a single query that solves a specific problem.
