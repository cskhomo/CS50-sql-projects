# Week 0: Querying

This folder contains my SQL solutions for Week 0 of **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL**, focusing on retrieving, filtering, and summarizing data across multiple datasets.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Writing `SELECT` queries to retrieve specific columns
- Filtering data with `WHERE` conditions, including `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `NULL`
- Pattern matching using `LIKE`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`, limiting output with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- Summarizing data using aggregate functions such as `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`, and `DISTINCT`

## Problem Sets

- **Cyberchase** – Queried a real-world dataset of TV episodes, applying filtering, ordering, and aggregation to extract insights
- **Normals** – Analyzed scientific datasets, performing numeric calculations, ranges, and averages
- **Views** – Processed artwork data, leveraging filtering, ordering, and aggregate functions to evaluate attributes like brightness and contrast
- **Players** – Explored historical sports data to extract player statistics and attributes

> [!NOTE]  
> The `.sql` files each contain a single query that solves a specific problem.
